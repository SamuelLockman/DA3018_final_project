This weekend I have been looking over what I did this spring before realizing I had to much to do to finish this
project. I also repeated what seemed to be most useful for solving this project. After having gone through the material
again, I realize that my approach I had the last time was uneccesarily hard. Thus, I have created a new repository on
github for this final version.

Today I did two awk scripts, "remove" and "counter". "remove" removes all
contigs that are contained in some other contig, so no two lines will be
identical in the datafile. As I did now is very memory intensive, so if I
find a better way to do it, I will create a new script. Now it works by
going over the data tiwce, first to check which vertices are doublets;
which it does by storing them in a hash table. Then a second time to
remove the doublets. The second script "counter" simlpy counts the number of contigs in the
file. 

By removing the doublets, the number of contigs reduced from 11393435
to 2358788. The first removal is stored in the file "remove1_overlaps.m4"

In the problem description, we got that the line with contigs X and Y is the same as the line with contigs Y and X.
Thus, I did an awk script to place the "largest" contig first. Then I ran "remove" on it again to remove all the
doublets in this manner. After doing this I ran counter again and apparently, there were no such doublets since it was still
2358788 lines in the file.

Today I created the awk script "to_integers" that maps each contig to an integer.
I should have done this earlier but I was so focused on trying to shorten 
the file that I missed it.

Today I tried reading up on the Java side of the course, since I reckon it would probably be way easier
to solve the computational problemns there. I started doing something in java, but I spent most of my time going
over my old labs. I think for tomorrow what I need to do is to represent the graph in an adjacency list 
and maybe either use DFS or BFS to determine the components and sizes.
