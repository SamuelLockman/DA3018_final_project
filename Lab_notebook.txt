This weekend I have been looking over what I did this spring before realizing I had to much to do to finish this
project. I also repeated what seemed to be most useful for solving this project. After having gone through the material
again, I realize that my approach I had the last time was uneccesarily hard. Thus, I have created a new repository on
github for this final version.
